		<h1>Cristian Palma</h1>
		<p>
			Hey! I'm a first-year PhD student in Operations Research at Cornell University, and very fortunate to be
			advised by Éva Tardos.
			My research interests include algorithmic game theory, approximation algorithms and integer linear programs,
			particularly for load balancing problems.
		</p>

		<p>
			Previously, I graduated with a double degree from Universidad de Chile and École CentraleSupélec, with a MSc
			in Applied Mathematics.
			My master's thesis is titled Load Balancing Algorithms on Scheduling Problems with a Concave Function of the
			Load, where I was lucky to be advised and guided by José Soto.
		</p>

		<p>
			Soon my cv, projects, experience and skills will be available here!
